### An extremely basic plugin example, for my friends using Sublime Text 2.

Drop this subdirectory into your Packages directory (Preferences > Browse Packages) to "install" it.

## Currently

### selection_to_upper ###
Replaces any selected text with it's upper-cased counterpart. Adds an item to the context ("right click") menu, and a keybinding/shortcut to call this action. Basic example of doing something to selected text, and replacing the selected regions.
